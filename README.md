# Essential Dynamic Library
EDL is just a helper extension for GMS2.

It's very useful for working outside the sandbox... it was fun making this extension!

Every function in this library is very easy to use.

Also please give feedback if you found bugs or want more guides, more features or you found mistakes or... typo?

You can work with filesystem.

Also you can control your window, most window functions not only used for your game window it also can work with other windows but keep in mind that some windows uses a different styles so it may not work with it.

And there is alot more i can tell you... but am so lazy for that go check by yourself the example project it has a guide note!

If i update the library the project will be updated too!

Keep in mind for now i tested it on Windows 10 x64 so please tell me if it is working for you.

And i don't have linux or MacOS so if you really want support for those tell me and i will try to learn and code for them with no testing but you will be the testor okay...!

The download section "Releases" you will always see four files.

1- Essential.Dynamic.Library.Demo.v$-$-$.zip
Like you see it says Demo that mean it's just an example program to see what this extension can do, all you need is just extract it to folder and run the EDL.exe that's it.

2- Essential.Dynamic.Library.Project.v$-$-$.zip
This is the Source Code project in GMS2 am always using the latest beta version for it.

3- Essential.Dynamic.Library.v$-$-$.yymps
The Package all you need is just drag and drop it to your game to import it and all done you can now use the extension.

4- Essential.Dynamic.Library.v$-$-$.yyz
This is the same as the project .zip but exported as .yyz file.

And about the source code section i will include it later...
