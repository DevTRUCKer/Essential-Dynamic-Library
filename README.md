# Essential Dynamic Library
EDL is just a helper extension for GMS2.

Its very useful for working outside the sandbox... it was fun making this extension!

Every function in this library is very easy to use.

Also please give feedback if you found bugs or want more guides, more features... typo?

You can work with filesystem for files and folders.
Also you can control your window, most window functions can be used not even for your game window only.

And there is alot more i can type more but am so lazy for that go check by yourself the example project it has a guide note!

If i update the library the project will be updated too!

Keep in mind for now i tested it on Windows 10 x64 so please tell me if it is working for you.

Have fun~ (o゜▽゜)o☆.
